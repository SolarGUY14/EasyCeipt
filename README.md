# EasyCeipt

A modern web application built with Next.js, Flask, and Supabase.

The purpose of this Web-Application is to log purchases and generate receipts. A purchase tracking system primarily built for my local hometown school district, to help numerous clubs, namely STEM clubs like the robotics clubs that require a lot of external purchases to help them build what they need to build. This app is designed to make purchase-tracking quick and simple, and if a report ever needs to be submitted to someones local district, it simply takes one click of a button with EasyCeipt.
